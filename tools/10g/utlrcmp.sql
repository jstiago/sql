Rem    NAME
Rem      utlrcmp.sql - Utility package for dependency-based recompilation
Rem                    of invalid objects sequentially or in parallel.
Rem
Rem    DESCRIPTION
Rem      This script provides a packaged interface to recompile invalid
Rem      PL/SQL modules, Java classes, indextypes and operators in a
Rem      database sequentially or in parallel.
Rem
Rem      This script is particularly useful after a major-version upgrade.
Rem      A major-version upgrade typically invalidates all PL/SQL and Java
Rem      objects. Although invalid objects are recompiled automatically on
Rem      use, it is useful to run this script ahead of time (e.g. as one of
Rem      the last steps in your migration), since this will either eliminate
Rem      or minimize subsequent latencies caused due to on-demand automatic
Rem      recompilation at runtime.
Rem
Rem   PARALLELISM AND PERFORMANCE
Rem      Parallel recompilation can exploit multiple CPUs to reduce the time
Rem      taken to recompile invalid objects. The degree of parallelism is
Rem      specified by the first argument to UTL_RECOMP.RECOMP_PARALLEL(). 
Rem      If the specified degree of parallelism is NULL, 0, or negative,
Rem      RECOMP_PARALLEL computes a default degree of parallelism as
Rem      the product of Oracle parameters "cpu_count" and
Rem      "parallel_threads_per_cpu". On a Real Application Clusters
Rem      installation, the degree of parallelism is the sum of individual
Rem      settings on each node in the cluster.
Rem      
Rem      Please note that the process of recompiling an invalid
Rem      object writes a significant amount of data to system tables and is
Rem      fairly I/O intensive. A slow disk system may be a significant
Rem      bottleneck and limit speedups available from a higher degree of
Rem      parallelism.
Rem     
Rem   EXAMPLES
Rem      1. Recompile all objects sequentially:
Rem             execute utl_recomp.recomp_serial();
Rem
Rem      2. Recompile objects in schema SCOTT sequentially:
Rem             execute utl_recomp.recomp_serial('SCOTT');
Rem
Rem      3. Recompile all objects using 4 parallel threads:
Rem             execute utl_recomp.recomp_parallel(4);
Rem
Rem      4. Recompile objects in schema JOE using the default degree
Rem         of parallelism.
Rem             execute utl_recomp.recomp_parallel(NULL, 'JOE');
Rem
Rem   NOTES
Rem      * You must be connected AS SYSDBA using SQL*PLUS to run this script.
Rem      * This script uses the job queue for parallel recompilation.
Rem      * This script expects the following packages to have been created with
Rem        VALID status:
Rem          STANDARD       (standard.sql)
Rem          DBMS_STANDARD  (dbmsstdx.sql)
Rem      * There should be no other DDL on the database while running 
Rem        entries in this package. Not following this recommendation may
Rem        lead to deadlocks.
