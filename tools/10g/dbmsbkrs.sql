--***************
-- Introduction
--***************
  -- This package contains the interface to the kernel for creating and
  -- restoring backups of datafiles and archived logs. Backups can exist on
  -- sequential media such as tape. The kernel will read and write backups,
  -- but it is the responsibility of the caller to catalog the names of the
  -- backups.
  --
  -- None of the procedures in this package can be executed in a Multi
  -- Threaded Server process. A connection to a dedicated server is required.
  --
  -- Many of these procedures create or retrieve records from the controlfile.
  -- Each record is given a record ID and a stamp when it is created. The
  -- record ID is a monotonically increasing integer that is incremented for
  -- each new record that is created. A different counter is used for each
  -- type of record. Only a certain number of records of each type are kept.
  -- Thus records are overwritten when they get old, but the new record will
  -- have a new record ID. The record ID should normally be unique but there
  -- is the possibility of a backup controlfile restore or a create controlfile
  -- that allows record IDs to be reused. A stamp is also allocated with every
  -- new controlfile record to ensure there is no confusion between records
  -- with the same record ID. The stamp is based on the time and date.

--*****************
-- Device control
--*****************
  -- Unlike other Oracle files, backups may be put on removable media which
  -- must be written sequentially. This may involve using a device to mount
  -- the removable media. These procedures provide an interface for controlling
  -- the device used for creating and restoring backups.

  FUNCTION deviceAllocate( type    IN  varchar2 default NULL
                          ,name    IN  varchar2 default NULL
                          ,ident   IN  varchar2 default NULL
                          ,noio    IN  boolean  default FALSE
                          ,params  IN  varchar2 default NULL )
    RETURN varchar2;

  -- Describe the device to be used for sequential I/O. For device types where
  -- only one process at a time can use a device, this call allocates a device
  -- for exclusive use by this session. The device remains allocated until
  -- deviceDeallocate is called or session termination. The device can be used
  -- both for creating and restoring backups.
  --
  -- Specifying a device allocates a context that exists until the session
  -- terminates or deviceDeallocate is called. Only one device can be specified
  -- at a time for a particular session. Thus deviceDeallocate must be called
  -- before a different device can be specified. This is not a limitation since
  -- a session can only read or write one backup at a time.
  --
  -- The other major effect of allocating a device is to specify the name space
  -- for the backup handles (file names). The handle for a sequential file does
  -- not necessarily define the type of device used to write the file. Thus it
  -- is necessary to specify the device type in order to interpret the file
  -- handle. The NULL device type is defined for all systems. It is the file
  -- system supplied by the operating system. The sequential file handles are
  -- thus normal file names.
  --
  -- A device can be specified either by name or by type.
  --    If the type is specified but not the name, the system picks an
  --    available device of that type.
  --    If the name is specified but not the type, the type is determined
  --    from the device.
  --    If neither the type or the name is given, the backups are files in
  --    the operating system file system.

  -- Note that some types of devices, optical disks for example, can be shared
  -- by many processes, and thus do not really require allocation of the device
  -- itself. However we do need to allocate the context for accessing the
  -- device, and we do need to know the device type for proper interpretation
  -- of the file handle. Thus it is always necessary to make the device
  -- allocation call before making most other calls in this package.
  --
  -- Input parameters:
  --   type
  --     If specified, this gives the type of device to use for sequential
  --     I/O. The allowed types are port specific. For example a port may
  --     support the type "TAPE" which is implemented via the Oracle tape
  --     API. If no type is specified, it may be implied by specifying a
  --     particular device name to allocate. The type should be allowed to
  --     default to NULL if operating system files are to be used.
  --
  --   name
  --     If specified, this names a particular piece of hardware to use for
  --     accessing sequential files. If not specified, any available
  --     device of the correct type will be allocated. If the device cannot
  --     be shared, it is allocated to this session for exclusive use.
  --     The name should be allowed to default to NULL if operating system
  --     files are to be used.
  --
  --   ident
  --     This is the users identifier that he uses to name this device. It
  --     is only used to report the status of this session via
  --     dbms_application_info.  This value will be placed in the CLIENT_INFO
  --     column of the V$SESSION table, in the row corresponding to the
  --     session in which the device was allocated.  This value can also
  --     be queried with the dbms_application_info.read_client_info procedure.
  --
  --   noio
  --     If TRUE, the device will not be used for doing any I/O. This allows
  --     the specification of a device type for deleting sequential files
  --     without actually allocating a piece of hardware. An allocation for
  --     noio can also be used for issuing device commands. Note that some
  --     commands may actually require a physical device and thus will get
  --     an error if the allocate was done with noio set to TRUE.
  --
  --   params
  --     This string is simply passed to the device allocate OSD. It is
  --     completely port and device specific.
  --
  -- Returns:
  --   It returns a valid device type. This is the type that should be
  --   allocated to access the same sequential files at a later date. Note
  --   that this might not be exactly the same value as the input string.
  --   The allocate OSD may do some translation of the type passed in. The
  --   return value is NULL when using operating system files.
  --
  -- Exceptions:
  --   DEVICE-TYPE-TOO-LONG (ora-19700)
  --     The device type is longer than the port-specific maximum.
  --   DEVICE-NAME-TOO-LONG (ora-19701)
  --     The device name is longer than the port-specific maximum.
  --   MULTI-THREADED-SERVER (ora-19550)
  --     This session is not connected to a dedicated server.
  --   DEVICE-ALLOCATED (ora-19568)
  --     This session already has a device allocated.
  --   ALLOCATION-FAILURE (ora-19554)
  --     The allocation failed.  Other messages should also be issued.
  --   DEVICE-BUSY (ora-19551)
  --     The requested device is allocated to another session, or no
  --     device was named,or all devices of the requested type are busy.
  --   INVALID-DEVICE-TYPE (ora-19552)
  --     The device type is not a recognized type.
  --   INVALID-DEVICE-NAME (ora-19553)
  --     The device name is not a recognized device.
  --   DEVICE-ERROR (ora-19557)
  --     The OSD returned an error.

  -- deviceStatus returns information about the currently allocated device.

  -- be NO_DEVICE and all the other values will be NULL.
  --
  -- Note that there are no exceptions since this does nothing but return
  -- information about this session.
  --
  -- Output parameters:
  --   state
  --     This defines what kind of allocation has been done. The constants
  --     have the following meanings.
  --       NO_DEVICE
  --         No device has been allocated by this session. The other output
  --         values will be NULL when this state is returned. Note that this
  --         state does not signal an error.
  --       NO_IO_ALLOC
  --         A device, or at least a device type, has been allocated, but the
  --         noio parameter was TRUE when deviceAllocate was called. It is not
  --         possible to do a backup or restore, but changeBackupPiece can be
  --         called.
  --       EXCL_ALLOC
  --         A device has been exclusively allocated to this session. This type
  --         of device can not support access by more than one session. A tape
  --         drive is typical of this kind of allocate.
  --       CONCUR_ALLOC
  --         A device has been allocated which supports multiple processes
  --         concurrently accessing its storage. A hierarchical storage manager
  --         is an example of this kind of device. The device name may be NULL
  --         for this kind of allocation since there may not be any particular
  --         piece of hardware reserved.
  --       FILESYSTEM
  --         This means that deviceAllocate was called with NULL type and name.
  --         The allocated device is the operating system's file system. This
  --         naturally allows concurrent accesses. The type and name parameters
  --         returned will both be NULL.
  --   type
  --     This is the type name of the allocated device. This may be different
  --     than the value passed in to deviceAllocate if a generic device type
  --     was converted to a specific type when the allocation was done. For
  --     example maybe the type given to deviceAllocate was 'TAPE'. This value
  --     could then be 'IBM3490'. NULL may have been given to deviceAllocate
  --     and the type determined from the device name. The returned type will
  --     be NULL only when the state is FILESYSTEM.
  --   name
  --     This is the name of the particular piece of hardware that was
  --     allocated. For device types that do not reserve particular pieces
  --     of hardware this will be NULL.
  --   bufsz
  --   bufcnt
  --     These two arguments describe the memory buffers that were allocated
  --     to do I/O to this device. If opened for noio these values will be
  --     zero. The bufsz is in bytes.
  --   kbytes
  --   readrate
  --   parallel
  --     These are the current values of the backup limits that have been set
  --     by calls to setLimit.

 --***********************************
 -- Backup Limits Setting Procedures--
--***********************************--
  -- There are a few limits that can be set to control the performance of
  -- taking a backup, and the size of each piece of the backup. The limit
  -- values are kept per session. Limits are initially set to infinity. Once
  -- changed, they persist until the device is deallocated. They may be changed
  -- at any time while a device is allocated. For each limit there is a
  -- constant that names it for the purpose of changing it. The following
  -- limits are defined.

  KBYTES     constant binary_integer := 1;
  READRATE   constant binary_integer := 2;
  PARALLEL   constant binary_integer := 3;
  DUPCNT     constant binary_integer := 4;
  DUR_EST_SECS    constant  binary_integer := 5;
  DUR_ENDTIME     constant  binary_integer := 6;
  MAX_READ_KBYTES constant  binary_integer := 7;
  SLEEP_SECS      constant  binary_integer := 8;
  DUR_SOFTENDTIME constant  binary_integer := 9;

  -- KBYTES:   The number of bytes that may be written to a backup piece.
  --
  --           It is given in units of 1024 bytes to avoid a 4 gigabyte limit.
  --           Once this number of bytes have been written, the backup piece
  --           is closed and the currently executing backupPieceCreate
  --           procedure returns control. If the backup set is not complete,
  --           the backupPieceCreate must be called again to
  --           continue the backup into another backup piece.
  --
  --           This limit is useful for cases where the size of the output
  --           media is known to the user but not to the operating system.

  -- READRATE: The number of buffers that may be read per file per second.
  --
  --           Use of this option causes the backup to limit the rate at
  --           which it reads blocks from a file. This limit has no effect if
  --           it is greater than the actual capacity. For some output devices
  --           it may be necessary to read from multiple files in order to keep
  --           the device streaming.
  --
  --           This limit is useful to prevent the backup process from
  --           consuming too much disk bandwidth, thereby degrading on-line
  --           performance.
  --
  --           Note that this limit is implemented by counting down the limit
  --           number, and check if a second has passed since the counter was
  --           last initialized. Thus the limit is only an average over one
  --           second, not enforced on every I/O.

  -- PARALLEL: The maximum number of files that will be open for reading at
  --           the same time.
  --
  --           If this limit is greater than the number of files in the backup,
  --           all files can be open for reading. Note that each open file can
  --           be read at no more than READRATE I/O's per second, so this
  --           limits the rate at which the output file can be written.
  --           This limit is useful to keep the number of open files down to a
  --           reasonable value when there are a large number of small redo
  --           logs in a backup.
  --
  --           Note that changing this value during a conversation has no
  --           effect.
  -- DUPCNT:   Duplex count for the channel. Allowed range for values is 1-4.
  -- DUR_EST_SECS : Number of seconds estimated for the backupset/copy
  --           performed on this device.
  -- DUR_ENDTIME : Time limit for the backupset/copy performed on this device.
  --               If the backup/copy could not be completed by this time,
  --               server returns an time out error. Client can extend the time
  --               and re-try the operation if required.
  -- MAX_READ_KBYTES : This limits specifies the maximum number of kilo bytes
  --               that can be read during backup/copy.
  -- SLEEP_SECS    : This is artifial time introduced during the last
  --                  backup/copy on this channel.
  -- DUR_SOFTENDTIME : Time limit for the backupset/copy after which the job
  --               can run at full speed.

  PROCEDURE setLimit( name   IN  binary_integer
                     ,value  IN  number );

 --********************************************
 -- Backup Conversation Initiation Procedures--
 --*******************************************--

  -- A backup conversation is a sequence of calls to create a backup of
  -- one or more files. The files may be either archived redo logs or
  -- datafiles. A controlfile may be included in a datafile backup. The backup
  -- consists of one or more sequential files called backup pieces. The pieces
  -- taken together make a backup set. A successful backup conversation
  -- consists of the following phases:
  --   1) Start conversation specifying the type of backup.
  --   2) Name the files that go into the backup.
  --   3) Create each piece of the backup.
  --   4) Collect data on the contents of the backup.

  PROCEDURE backupSetDataFile( set_stamp     OUT  number
                              ,set_count     OUT  number
                              ,nochecksum    IN   boolean         default FALSE
                              ,tag           IN   varchar2        default NULL
                              ,incremental   IN   boolean         default FALSE
                              ,backup_level  IN   binary_integer  default 0 );

  -- backupSetDataFile starts a backup conversation to backup datafiles and
  -- possibly a controlfile.

  PROCEDURE backupSetArchivedLog( set_stamp   OUT  number
                             ,set_count   OUT  number
                             ,nochecksum  IN   boolean        default FALSE );

  -- backupSetArchivedLog starts a backup conversation to backup archived redo
  -- logs.

  -- No information is placed into the controlfile until the entire backup
  -- set is complete.  The setid and stamp parameters returned by
  -- backupSetDataFile or backupSetArchivedLog are the key that can be used to
  -- identify all controlfile data created by this conversation.
  --
  -- The database must be mounted to create a backup set. A device must
  -- have already been allocated for creating backup pieces.
  --
  -- It is acceptable to create a backup when a backup controlfile has been
  -- mounted. However, note that the files named in the controlfile
  -- may no longer exist. Logs archived since the controlfile backup will
  -- not be in V$ARCHIVED_LOG. Missing files will not be detected until they
  -- are read while creating a backup piece. This makes it impossible to
  -- continue the backup conversation.
  --
  -- A row is also added to V$SESSION_LONGOPS to record the progress of
  -- the backup. The whole column will contain the number of blocks that
  -- will be read from the datafiles or archived redo logs. The total will be
  -- increased as files are added to the backup. Progress will be indicated
  -- as the backup pieces are created.
  --
  -- When backing up datafiles, blocks that have never been modified will
  -- not be put into the backup. Note that this does not avoid blocks that
  -- were once in use but are not part of any object at this time. A future
  -- version may avoid these blocks.

  --   tag
  --     The tag stored in the file header of the copied and backed up files,
  --     and also in the controlfile records describing those files.
  --   incremental
  --     Specifies whether or not this backup set is part of the database's
  --     incremental backup hierarchy.  If false, then the backup is not part
  --     of the hierarchy.This does not affect the file backup process - it is
  --     simply stored in the controlfile and reflected in the V$BACKUP_SET and
  --     V$BACKUP_DATAFILE views.
  --   nochecksum
  --     If true, we will not calculate a checksum on blocks that
  --     do not have a checksum. If there is a checksum in a block it is
  --     always validated after reading, and it is saved in the backup.
  --   backup_level
  --     This indicates the location of this backup set in the database's
  --     incremental backup hierarchy.  If zero, then a full backup will be
  --     produced, which must be restored with restoreSetDataFile.  If
  --     non-zero, then a valid SCN must be supplied with all calls to
  --     backupDataFile[Copy], and an incremental backup set will be produced,
  --     which must be restored with applySetDataFile.
  --
  -- Output parameters:
  --   set_stamp and set_count, taken together, form the primary key used to
  --   identify records for this backup set in the following fixed views:
  --     V$BACKUP_SET
  --     V$BACKUP_PIECE
  --     V$BACKUP_DATAFILE
  --     V$BACKUP_REDOLOG
  --     V$BACKUP_CORRUPTION
  --
  --   Note that set_stamp and set_count are NOT the recid and stamp of the
  --   circular-reuse record that is created in v$backup_set for this backup
  --   set.  These separately maintained fields are used as the backup set
  --   key because they are obtained when the backup set is begun and can be
  --   placed in each backup piece.  The recid/stamp of the v$backup_set
  --   record are not obtained until the backup set is complete, and so cannot
  --   be placed in each backup piece.
  --
  --   set_stamp
  --     This is a timestamp that is used to identify the backup set.
  --   set_count
  --     This is a counter that is kept in the database information
  --     section of the mounted controlfile.  During backup set
  --     conversation initialization, a read/write controlfile transaction is
  --     used to increment this counter by one.

  -- Exceptions:
  --   TAG-TOO-LONG (ora-19705)
  --     The tag is longer than the port-specific maximum.
  --   CONVERSATION-ACTIVE (ora-19590)
  --     A backup or restore conversation is already active in this session.
  --   MULTI-THREADED-SERVER (ora-19550)
  --     This session is not connected to a dedicated server.
  --   ALTERNATE-CONTROLFILE-OPEN (ora-226)
  --     This session's fixed tables are currently re-directed to a snapshot
  --     or other alternate controlfile.
  --   DATABASE-NOT-MOUNTED (ora-1507)
  --     No database is mounted.

 --*********************************
 -- Backup File List Specification
 --*********************************

  -- The second phase of taking a backup is to list the files that go into
  -- the backup. Files are listed by controlfile record. A number of files
  -- may need to be in a single backup in order to provide enough data to
  -- keep the output device streaming. However, backups of large databases
  -- should be partitioned into different backup conversations so that the
  -- conversations can be done in parallel, minimizing the restore times for
  -- any particular datafile. Restoring only one file from a backup set
  -- requires a sequential scan through the entire backup set, until the
  -- required file is completely restored.
  --
  -- Note that an error adding a file to a backup does not terminate the
  -- backup conversation. More files can still be added, or piece creation
  -- can begin, if at least one file has been successfully added.

  PROCEDURE backupDataFile( dfnumber      IN  binary_integer
                           ,since_change  IN  number          default 0
                           ,max_corrupt   IN  binary_integer  default 0 );

  -- Add a data file to a backup set. backupDataFile backups a current
  -- datafile in the database. The file may be either online or offline.

  PROCEDURE backupDataFileCopy( copy_recid    IN  number
                               ,copy_stamp    IN  number
                               ,since_change  IN  number          default 0
                               ,max_corrupt   IN  binary_integer  default 0 );

  -- Add a data file to a backup set. backupDataFileCopy backups a copy of
  -- a datafile that was made via copyDataFile or some operating system
  -- utility. If the copy was made by operation system utility, it may be
  -- necessary to call inspectDataFileCopy to build a controlfile record
  -- for this copy before calling backupDataFileCopy.

  -- From the time that a datafile is named as part of a backup set until
  -- the last backup piece containing any portion of the datafile is
  -- successfully created, the backup session holds a shared file access
  -- enqueue on the file, making it impossible to drop it from the database
  -- or take it offline normal. If the file goes offline immediate before
  -- it is opened for placing in the backup set, it will fail with an error
  -- reading the file.
  --
  -- Input parameters:
  --   dfnumber
  --     Data file number of a file to backup. This refers to the file that
  --     is currently accessible via SQL commands.
  --   copy_recid
  --     The record ID from V$DATAFILE_COPY for the datafile copy. This
  --     is the record ID returned from copyDataFile or inspectDataFileCopy.
  --   copy_stamp
  --     The stamp corresponding to copy_recid. This is to insure that the
  --     record is the same one that was selected.
  --   since_change
  --     Only blocks modified since this SCN will be included in the backup.
  --     This creates an incremental backup that can only be applied to a
  --     datafile that is checkpointed between this SCN and the backup's
  --     checkpoint. Note that an incremental backup cannot change the
  --     resetlogs stamp in a file, so this SCN may not be less than the
  --     ressetlogs SCN in the file header.
  --   max_corrupt
  --     Up to this many data blocks from this file can be made corrupt in the
  --     backup. The whole backup will fail if more blocks are found corrupt.
  --     This does not count blocks that were already marked corrupt in the
  --     datafile. It only counts blocks that failed verification when they
  --     were read, and had to be reformatted to be corrupt in the backup. Note
  --     that such blocks are always included in incremental backups since we
  --     cannot know when the last change was made.
  -- Exceptions:
  --   INVALID-SCN (ora-19706)
  --     The incremental start SCN could not be converted into the internal
  --     SCN representation because it is non-integral, less than zero, or
  --     greater than the highest possible SCN.

  --   media
  --     The media handle returned by the operating system. This is the name

  --     the backup piece. For some devices this information will not be
  --     provided.
  --   concur
  --     TRUE if the device type used to create this piece

  -- This procedure copies a backup piece that was originally written to an
  -- operating system file, onto sequential media. This requires allocating
  -- a sequential device first. Of course, this could copy to another operating
  -- system file if the NULL device is allocated.
  --
  -- A record is made in the controlfile as if the piece was just created and
  -- written to this output file. It can be queried from V$BACKUP_PIECE using
  -- the record ID returned. Note that no new entries are made in V$BACKUP_SET,
  -- V$BACKUP_DATAFILE, V$BACKUP_REDOLOG, or V$BACKUP_CORRUPTION.
  --
  -- It is acceptable to copy a backup piece when a backup controlfile has been
  -- mounted. However, note that the files named in the control
  -- file may no longer exist.
  --
  -- Input parameters:
  --   bpname
  --     Operating system file name of the existing backup piece. This will be
  --     read and copied to sequential media.
  --   fname
  --     Filename of the backup piece to be created. This will be translated
  --     into a file handle after the piece is created.
  --   tag
  --     The tag stored in the file header of the copied and backed up files,
  --     and also in the controlfile records describing those files.
  --   params
  --     This string is simply passed to the sequential file create OSD. It is
  --     completely port and device specific.
  -- Output parameters:
  --   handle
  --     The handle for the backup piece that was created. This is a permanent
  --     name that can be used to read this sequential file for restore. It
  --     can only be used with the same device type that was allocated at
  --     this call.
  --   comment
  --     The comment for the backup piece. This is any string that the OSD
  --     decided was useful. It will be a null string for operating system
  --     files. Note that this comment is not the same as the comment where the
  --     original backup piece was created.
  --   media
  --     The media handle returned by the operating system. This is the name
  --     of media where the file was created. It is not needed for retrieving
  --     the backup piece. For some devices this information will not be
  --     provided.
  --   concur
  --     TRUE if the device type used to create this piece
  --     supports multiple processes concurrently accessing the same media.
  --     If FALSE, it is best to only have one process at a time
  --     doing a restore of backup pieces with the same media handle.
  --   recid
  --     This is the ID of the record in the controlfile where the
  --     information about this backup piece was recorded. It can be used as
  --     the primary key to query V$BACKUP_PIECE.
  --   stamp
  --     This is a number that can be used to verify that the row in
  --     V$BACKUP_PIECE is really for this backup piece. The stamp combined
  --     with recid makes a key that is unique for this backup piece for all
  --     time.
  --   media_pool
  --     a number from 0-255 whose meaning is defined by rman or by 3rd-party
  --     media management software.
  -- Exceptions:

  -- copyDataFileCopy is used to make a copy of a copy.

  -- These procedures make image copies of datafiles. An image copy is
  -- suitable for direct use by the database. Its name can be used in
  -- a rename command, then recovered to become current. It can also
  -- be copied to sequential media as part of a backup set. Some customers
  -- may want to keep an online image copy of all their datafiles as their
  -- most recent backup, then backup the image copy to tape. Note that
  -- these routines only make image copies on operating system files.
  -- It is impossible to put an image on sequential media. These procedures
  -- may NOT be executed during a backup or restore conversation. There must
  -- be a device allocated to the session and it must be the null device.
  --
  -- The procedure copyDataFile copies the current file in the database.
  -- The file may be either online or offline. The procedure copyDataFileCopy
  -- is used to make a copy of a copy. This may be advisable before using a
  -- copy for an incomplete recovery. If the incomplete recovery needs to
  -- be redone, the unrecovered file is still available on disk. For copying
  -- to the file specified by the controlfile, the fname parameter can be
  -- NULL. This is effectively a restore.  It is not permitted to overwrite
  -- the file named by the controlfile with a copy unless the creation time
  -- of the copy is the same as the creation time of the real file.
  --
  -- It is acceptable to copy a file when a backup controlfile has been
  -- mounted. However, note the files named in the control file may no
  -- longer exist.
  --
  -- In order to handle a failure during the copy, the output file header
  -- will have its file type set to zero until the copy is complete.  This
  -- insures it cannot be used until the copy is complete. When the copy is
  -- complete, a valid header, with all fuzziness removed except the
  -- calculated absolute fuzziness, is written to the file.
  --
  -- After the copy is complete, a record will be added to V$DATAFILE_COPY
  -- to describe the copied file.  If the destination was the named
  -- datafile (copyDataFileCopy was used and no filename was specified),
  -- then the underlying controlfile record will be immediately marked as
  -- obsolete, and will not appear in the V$DATAFILE_COPY view.  Before
  -- adding the new record to V$DATAFILE_COPY, the datafile copy record
  -- section of the controlfile will be scanned, looking for any existing
  -- copy records with the same filename.  If any such records are found,
  -- they will be marked obsolete.
  --
  -- If any corrupt blocks are found in the datafiles, then records will be
  -- inserted in V$COPY_CORRUPTION to describe the corrupt block ranges.
  --
  -- Input parameters:
  --   dfnumber
  --     Datafile number of a file to copy. This refers to the file that
  --     is currently accessible via SQL commands.
  --   copy_recid
  --     The record ID from V$DATAFILE_COPY for the datafile copy. This
  --     is the record ID returned from inspectDataFileCopy or a previous call
  --     to make a datafile copy.
  --   copy_stamp
  --     The stamp that corresponds to copy_recid. This is to insure that the
  --     record is the same one that was selected.
  --   max_corrupt
  --     Up to this many corrupt data blocks from this file can appear in the
  --     backup. The copy will fail if more blocks are found corrupt.
  --   fname
  --     File name to copy the image to. This name may not be useable by
  --     another process, so it will be expanded.
  --   tag
  --     The tag to be stored in the file header of the copied and backed up
  --     files, and also in the controlfile records describing those files.
  --   nochecksum
  --     If true, we will not calculate a checksum on blocks that
  --     do not have a checksum. If there is a checksum in a block it is
  --     always validated after reading, and it is saved in the copy.
  --   isbackup
  --     If true, then Recovery Manager is treating this file as a level 0
  --     backup in the database's recovery strategy.  This information is
  --     simply stored in the V$DATAFILE_COPY record created by this copy
  --     operation, and has no other effect.
  --
  -- Output parameters:

  --
  -- Unlike the other copy procedures, copyControlFile works when the

  --
  -- When the database is mounted:
  --
  --   Neither the source nor destination file may be an active file as
  --   specified in the initialization parameter.
  --
  --   The destination file may not be the snapshot controlfile.
  --
  --   After the copy is complete, a record will be placed into the
  --   V$DATAFILE_COPY view (in the current controlfile, not the copy)
  --   describing the copy.  The datafile number will be zero and the
  --   the datafile checkpoint will be the set to the controlfile checkpoint
  --   taken from the kccfhx.
  --
  -- When the database is NOT mounted:

  --   dest_name
  --     File name to copy the image to. This name may not be useable by

 --*********************************************
 -- Restore Conversation Initiation Procedures--
 --********************************************--

  -- A restore conversation is similar to a backup conversation except that
  -- it reads backups and creates operating system files. Either archived logs
  -- can be restored for use with recovery, or data files can be restored to
  -- be recovered. Restoring an incremental backup is equivalent to applying
  -- redo to an existing copy of the datafile. A successful restore
  -- conversation consists of the following phases:
  --   1) Start conversation specifying the type of backup.
  --   2) Specify which files to restore and where to restore them.
  --   3) Read consecutive pieces of the backup set until all the specified
  --      files have been restored.
  -- The restore conversation ends when the last file has been successfully
  -- restored.

  PROCEDURE restoreSetDataFile;
  -- restoreSetDataFile begins a conversation that will completely recreate
  -- datafiles and possibley a controlfile from the backup.

  PROCEDURE applySetDataFile;
  -- applySetDataFile begins a conversation that will apply incremental
  -- backups to existing datafiles.

  PROCEDURE restoreSetArchivedLog(destination IN varchar2 default NULL);
  -- restoreSetArchivedLog begins a conversation that will restore archived
  -- redo logs so that they can be applied by recovery.
  --
  -- These procedures begin a restore conversation. An appropriate context for
  -- the restore is allocated. The database does not need to be mounted to do a
  -- restore, but an instance must be started. A device must already be
  -- allocated for reading the backup pieces.
  --
  -- An instance must be started to call these procedures. If the controlfile
  -- is available, the database should be mounted. This provides better error
  -- checking, and allows specification of datafiles by file number
  --
  -- For a redo log conversation, a destination can be given for the
  -- location to create the logs. This is the same as giving a destination
  -- for archiving. The log_archive_format initialization parameter is used
  -- along with the destination to construct the name of the operating
  -- system files to create. If no destination is given, the current
  -- archiving destination is used.
  --
  -- Input parameters:
  --   destination
  --     This is used to construct the file name for creating the restored
  --     redo logs.
  -- Exceptions:
  --   DESTINATION-TOO-LONG (ora-19708)
  --     The specified archive log destination is longer than the port-
  --     specific maximum.
  --   CONVERSATION-ACTIVE (ora-19590)
  --     A backup or restore conversation is already active in this session.
  --   MULTI-THREADED-SERVER (ora-19550)
  --     This session is not connected to a dedicated server.
  --   ALTERNATE-CONTROLFILE-OPEN (ora-226)
  --     This session's fixed tables are currently re-directed to a snapshot
  --     or other alternate controlfile.
  --   DATABASE-NOT-MOUNTED (ora-1507)
  --     No database is mounted.

 --**********************************
 -- Restore File List Specification--
 --*********************************--

  -- The second phase of a restore conversation is to specify what to
  -- restore from a backup set and where to restore it. This is
  -- accomplished by calling these routines. Since a single backup set may
  -- contain multiple files, it may be necessary to make multiple calls
  -- to specify all the files to be restored.  Any files that appear in
  -- the backup set, but are not mentioned in any calls, will be ignored
  -- by the restore. No files can be added to the list once the first
  -- backup piece is read. Only one destination can be given per file to
  -- restore. Errors while specifying the files to restore do not
  -- terminate the conversation.

  PROCEDURE restoreControlfileTo(cfname IN varchar2);

  -- This copies the controlfile from the backup set to an operating system
  -- file. If the database is mounted, the name must NOT match any of the
  -- current controlfiles.
  --
  -- Input parameters:
  --   cfname
  --     Name of file to create or overwrite with the controlfile from the
  --     backup set. When passed as NULL and database is not mounted, we
  --     restore and replicate the controlfiles to all names that match
  --     current controlfiles in parameter file.
  -- Exceptions:
  --   NAME-TOO-LONG (ora-19704)
  --     The specified file name is longer than the port-specific
  --     maximum file name length.
  --   CONVERSATION-NOT-ACTIVE (ora-19580)
  --     A restore conversation was not started before specifying files.
  --   CANT-GET-INSTANCE-STATE-ENQUEUE (ora-1155)
  --     The database is in the process of being opened, closed, mounted,
  --     or dismounted.
  --   DATABASE-NOT-MOUNTED (ora-1507)
  --     The database is not mounted.
  --   WRONG-CONVERSATION-TYPE (ora-19592)
  --     This restore conversation is not for datafiles and controlfiles.
  --   CONVERSATION-IS-VALIDATE-ONLY (ora-19618)
  --     No files can be named after restoreValidate has been called.
  --   NAMING-PHASE-OVER (ora-19604)
  --     The first backup piece has been restored.  No more files can be
  --     named.
  --   NO-OUTPUT-FILENAME (ora-19574)
  --     dest_name must be assigned a non-NULL string in copyControlFile.
  --   DUPLICATE-CONTROLFILE (ora-19594)
  --     The controlfile has already been specified for restoration.
  --   FILE-IN-USE (ora-19584)
  --     The specified output file is already in use by the database as a
  --     datafile or online redo log.
  --   CONTROLFILE-IS-ACTIVE (ora-19607)
  --     The destination file is the same as one of the controlfiles specified
  --     in the init.ora file.
  --   CONTROLFILE-IS-SNAPSHOT (ora-19606)
  --     The destination file is the snapshot controlfile.  You cannot restore
  --     to the snapshot controlfile.

  PROCEDURE restoreDataFileTo( dfnumber  IN  binary_integer
                              ,toname    IN  varchar2       default NULL);
  --
  -- restoreDataFileTo creates the output file from a complete backup in the
  -- backup set.

  PROCEDURE applyDataFileTo( dfnumber        IN  binary_integer
                            ,toname          IN  varchar2       default NULL
                            ,fuzziness_hint  IN  number         default 0);
  --
  -- applyDataFileTo applies an incremental backup from the backup set to an
  -- existing copy of the datafile. Note that the incremental backup and the
  -- datafile must have the same resetlogs stamp, but this can not be detected
  -- until the restore is begun.

  -- Add this file to the list of files to read from the backup. The file may
  -- be written to either the current version of the datafile, or to another
  -- copy. The current version is written if toname is NULL, or if it is the
  -- name of the current file.
  --
  -- If no database is mounted, toname must be given.
  -- If the database is open, the file must be offline to write to the current
  -- version.
  -- If there is a failure during a restore, the file will not be usable.
  --
  -- If there is a failure during an apply, the file's checkpoint will not
  -- be advanced, and its absolute fuzziness will be set to either the
  -- fuzziness hint passed by the caller or the greatest fuzziness found in
  -- the file itself, whichever is greater.  Redo may be applied to
  -- compensate for the failed apply.
  --
  -- For full restores, in order to handle a failure during the restore,
  -- the output file header will have its file type set to zero until the
  -- restore is complete.  This insures it cannot be used until the restore
  -- is complete. When the restore is complete, a valid header, with all
  -- fuzziness removed except the calculated absolute fuzziness, is written
  -- to the file.
  --
  -- When a datafile block in a backup set is found to be corrupt, we don't
  -- know which file it belongs to.  The block will be discarded and a
  -- message will be written to the alert log.  We will only know which
  -- files contained corrupt blocks when their DBA checksums (see next
  -- paragraph) are later found to be invalid.  This only applies to blocks
  -- which fail cache header validation when read from the backup set, not
  -- to blocks that were marked media-corrupt or logically-corrupt when the
  -- backup set was created, but had valid cache headers.
  --
  -- A checksum is kept on all the DBAs stored in a backup set for each
  -- datafile.  This checksum is stored in the datafile header, which is
  -- the last block in the backup set for each datafile.  If, when reading
  -- the datafile header, the checksum in the header does not match, then
  -- some blocks destined for that datafile must have been corrupt.  If
  -- this is an incremental restore, the file's checkpoint will not be
  -- advanced, although its absolute fuzziness may be increased.  If this
  -- is a full restore, the file is invalid, and the header is not restored
  -- to a valid state.
  --
  -- It may also happen that the header is corrupt, and so is never seen.
  -- We will detect this when, prior to encountering the file's header, a
  -- piece header is read that indicates that the datafile should be
  -- completely contained on the prior pieces.  This will also cause the
  -- restore of that datafile to fail.
  --
  -- Input parameters:
  --   dfnumber
  --     The datafile number of the datafile to restore.
  --   toname
  --     The name of a file to create or overwrite with the datafile from the
  --     backup set.  This parameter is useful to direct the restore to a
  --     location different from the current datafile location.  If this
  --     parameter is not used, the current datafile is overlaid with
  --     the restored file. This parameter must be specified if the database
  --     is not mounted.
  --
  --     The filename cannot already exist in the controlfile unless it is the
  --     current name of this file. (This check is not performed if the
  --     database is not mounted.) After completing the restore, an "ALTER
  --     DATABASE RENAME FILE 'xxx' TO 'yyy'" command command may be issued
  --     to point the controlfile to the restored datafile.
  --   fuzziness_hint
  --     This is the highest SCN that the client believes is contained in any
  --     block in the backup datafile.  If the client supplies an accurate SCN
  --     then restore performance will be slightly improved, because the file
  --     header will only be re-written before restoring blocks with a higher
  --     SCN.  If the client supplies a number that is greater than the actual
  --     fuzziness in the file, and the restore ends prematurely, then the
  --     datafile may require more redo than is truly necessary to bring the
  --     file to a consistent state.
  --
  -- Exceptions:
  --   NAME-TOO-LONG (ora-19704)
  --     The specified file name is longer than the port-specific
  --     maximum file name length.

  PROCEDURE restoreValidate;

  -- This procedure is called to force the reading of the entire backup set as
  -- if all files in the backup were being restored. However no data will be
  -- written to any files. Incremental backup application does not require a

  -- file list may be made when this call is used.
  --
  -- After the conversation is complete, a report will be written to an oracle
  -- trace file, giving the status of all the files in the backup set.  The
  -- report looks like this:
  --
  -- Restore Conversation File Status Report
  --   File  Start Finish OK Name
  --   ----- ----- ------ -- --------------------

 --********************************
 -- Restoration from Backup Piece--
 --*******************************--

  -- The third phase of a restore conversation is to read the pieces that
  -- make up the backup set and write the output files specified in the second
  -- phase. It is impossible to check for errors such as specifying a file
  -- that is not in the backup set until the first piece is read. Errors while
  -- processing a backup piece do not terminate the conversation. If the error
  -- can be repaired (e.g. the correct file is found or the hardware is
  -- fixed), the piece may be successfully reread and restored. However if the
  -- conversation is terminated, the entire backup set must be reread in a new
  -- restore conversation.

  -- These procedures read one backup piece and write its contents to the

  -- restoreBackupPiece creates files from complete backups.
  -- applyBackupPiece applies incremental backups to existing datafiles.
  --
  -- As soon as each target file is complete, records will be created in
  -- the appropriate controlfile tables.  Records may be created in the

  --
  --   V$DATAFILE_COPY
  --   V$COPY_CORRUPTION
  --   V$ARCHIVED_LOG
  --
  -- If this was the last piece containing data required to restore the
  -- requested objects, then the "done" parameter is set to TRUE and the
  -- conversation is over.  All resources allocated for the conversation are
  -- released.
  --
  -- Input parameters:
  --   handle
  --     The handle of the backup piece to restore from.
  --   params
  --     This string is simply passed to the sequential file open OSD. It is

 -- Controlfile Fixed Table Redirection Procedures--
 --***********************************************--

  -- These procedures allow the X$KCC fixed tables to be redirected to read
  -- a "snapshot controlfile" or a backup or standby controlfile rather than
  -- the current controlfile. A snapshot controlfile is a dynamically created
  -- "consistent-read" copy that is created under a dynamically specified
  -- filename. A snapshot controlfile enqueue is used to enforce serialization
  -- across instances of the creation and use of the snapshot controlfile.

  PROCEDURE cfileSetSnapshotName( fname  IN  varchar2 );

  -- This procedure sets the filename to be used for the snapshot
  -- controlfile during subsequent invocations of cfileMakeAndUseSnapshot
  -- and cfileUseSnapshot. However, in case that input filename is NULL,
  -- the procedure deletes the filename record for the snapshot controlfile.
  -- It attempts to acquire the snapshot controlfile enqueue in X mode,
  -- exiting with an exception if it is not available. On success, it exits
  -- with the snapshot controlfile enqueue released.
  --
  -- In case that the filename is not NULL, the file name is saved in the
  -- controlfile so that it is known database wide for the life of the
  -- database. However it will not be known in a standby database. It is
  -- preserved in backup controlfiles.
  -- In case that the filename is NULL, the snapshot controlfile name is
  -- deleted from the control file. In this case, cfileMakeAndUseSnapshot and
  -- cfileUseSnapshot will use default name snapshot controlfile name.
  --
  -- The invoker must not be inside a controlfile transaction when this
  -- routine is called; nor must he already hold the snapshot controlfile
  -- enqueue [as would result, e.g. from a prior invocation of
  -- cfileMakeAndUseSnapshot or cfileUseSnapshot without a matching invocation
  -- of cfileUseCurrent or cfileUseCopy]; nor must he have a copy controlfile

  PROCEDURE switchToCopy( copy_recid  IN  number

  -- Causes the filename in the indicated datafile copy record to become

  --
  -- 1. Begin a read/write controlfile transaction.
  -- 2. If the database is open, ensure that the named file is not open.
  -- 3. Validate that the data in the V$DATAFILE_COPY record matches the
  --    data in the file header of the copied file.
  -- 4. Alter the file name entry for the named file to point to the copy.
  -- 5. Mark the V$DATAFILE_COPY record as deleted.
  -- 6. End the controlfile transaction.
  --
  -- Much of what this function does could have been done in the ordinary
  -- 'alter database rename file' code - that code could scan the
  -- V$DATAFILE_COPY records and delete any that are consumed by the
  -- rename.  The code could also perform the additional header validations
  -- that are required when we know that the destination file exists.
  -- There are two reasons why we decided not to do this:
  -- 1. No matter how efficient we are in deleting obsolete V$DATFILE_COPY
  --    records, the Recovery Manager will still need its own algorithm to
  --    detect when some operation has caused a named file to consume a
  --    datafile copy.  This is because the appropriate datafile copy record
  --    may have been reused in the controlfile, and only exists in the
  --    recovery catalog when, for example, a user issues a 'rename' that
  --    consumes a datafile copy.
  -- 2. If we decide to add such special handling for 'rename', we would also
  --    have to add code to 'alter tablespace add datafile', and perhaps other
  --    functions as well, and we don't want to do all that right now.
  --
  -- Input parameters:
  --   copy_recid
  --     The record ID from V$DATAFILE_COPY for the datafile copy. This
  --     is the record ID returned from inspectDataFileCopy or a previous call
  --     to make a datafile copy.
  --   copy_stamp
  --     The stamp that corresponds to copy_recid. This is to insure that the

  -- Proxy Copy procedures
  -- ********************************************************

  -- Proxy copy is a new backup paradigm.  Instead of Oracle reading
  -- the datafiles and passing the data to a storage subsystem (or doing
  -- the reverse when restoring), we simply pass the name of a file to be
  -- backed up, and a backup handle, to the storage subsystem, which
  -- handles all of the data movement.
  --
  -- These procedures are conversational, as are the backup/restore
  -- procedures above, and they also require that a device be allocated
  -- prior to calling them.  The allocated device may not be of type DISK,
  -- because the DISK device does not invoke an external media manager.
  --
  -- The parameters to these routines have the same semantics as the
  -- corresponding parameters to the non-proxy routines above.
  --
  -- A new controlfile record type is used to record the existence of proxy
  -- copies in the controlfile.  The same record type is used to store
  -- information about both proxy datafiles and proxy archived logs, but
  -- two different fixed views are used to display the information:
  -- v$proxy_datafile and v$proxy_archivedlog.

  -- Input Parameters
  --   tag
  --     An arbitrary user-defined tag, up to 30 characters long, that is
  --     stored in the controlfile record describing DATAFILES that are
  --     proxy backed up.  Proxy ARCHIVELOGS do not have a tag.
  --   incremental
  --     If TRUE, then this file will be considered as a level-0 incremental
  --     backup, which can be the basis for subsequent incremental backups.
  --     This applies only to datafiles, not archived logs.
  --   media_pool
  --     a number from 0-255 whose meaning is defined by rman or by 3rd-party
  --     media management software.
  --   set_stamp
  --   set_count
  --     a timestamp and counter that are used by recovery manager to generate
