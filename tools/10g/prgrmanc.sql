Rem      prgrmanc.sql
Rem    DESCRIPTION
Rem      Purges from RMAN Recovery Catalog the records marked as deleted by
Rem      the user.
Rem
Rem      It is up to the user to mark the records as deleted using the
Rem      RMAN command: CHANGE ... DELETE
Rem
Rem      The Media Manager catalog is not updated by this script, only
Rem      the recovery catalog
Rem
Rem      As of 8.1.6 records removed by this script will not be reinserted
Rem      if a "resync from backup controlfile" is performed.  
Rem      Versions previous to 8.1.6 might reinsert the records, this might undo
Rem      both the CHANGE...DELETE and the physical delete of the record.
Rem
Rem      This script removes records from the following tables:
Rem          AL 
Rem          RLH
Rem          BP
Rem          BS
Rem          BCF
Rem          BDF
Rem          BCB
Rem          BRL
Rem          CCF
Rem          CDF
Rem          CCB
Rem          XCF (for 8.1)
Rem          XDF (for 8.1)
