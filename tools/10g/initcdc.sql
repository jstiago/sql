REM
REM Data Pump support
REM
REM Register calls to support full-database export of CDC objects
REM (most processing is at schema level for future schema-level support,
REM but can only support database-level for 10iR1 because this is the
REM only level supported for Streams.)
REM
REM During export, CDC generates various import PL/SQL calls that
REM create CDC metadata rows during the import. The import calls do
REM not perform any validation on the new metadata rows except for
REM duplicate index errors.
REM
REM During export, CDC also creates, populates, exports and deletes an
REM import validation table for each schema that owns CDC objects. This
REM table is used to control validation of CDC objects during the import
REM after all schemas have been imported. This accounts for cases where,
REM for example, a change set owned by one publisher contains a change
REM table owned by a different publisher. During import, each schema's
REM import validation table is deleted after it has been processed.

DELETE FROM sys.exppkgact$
WHERE schema = 'SYS' AND package IN ('DBMS_CDC_EXPDP', 'DBMS_CDC_EXPVDP');

REM pre-system action generates call to bump system SCN
REM should execute early

INSERT INTO sys.exppkgact$ (package, schema, class, level#)
  VALUES ('DBMS_CDC_EXPDP', 'SYS', 1, 1);

REM pre-schema callout creates and populates schema's import validation table
REM post-schema callout drops schema's import validation table

INSERT INTO sys.exppkgact$ (package, schema, class, level#)
  VALUES ('DBMS_CDC_EXPDP', 'SYS', 6, 1000);

REM post-schema action generates PL/SQL calls to import CDC objects
REM (must be BEFORE Streams actions so that CDC metadata is present
REM  before Streams attempts to start any CDC apply handlers)

INSERT INTO sys.exppkgact$ (package, schema, class, level#)
  VALUES ('DBMS_CDC_EXPDP', 'SYS', 2, 1000);

REM post-schema action generates validation call for schema
REM (must be AFTER all CDC imports for all schemas have executed)
REM (must also be AFTER Streams actions for all schemas have executed
REM  so that Streams objects are present for validation)

INSERT INTO sys.exppkgact$ (package, schema, class, level#)
  VALUES ('DBMS_CDC_EXPVDP', 'SYS', 2, 6000);
