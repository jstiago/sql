Rem    NAME
Rem      catrul.sql - Top level script to load Rules Manager
Rem
Rem    DESCRIPTION
Rem      The Rules Manager stores, manages, and enforces Event-Condition-
Rem      Action rules in the database. This relies on the Expression 
Rem      Filter functionality and the Expression Filter should be
Rem      installed prior to installing Rules Manager
Rem
Rem    NOTES
Rem      The 'XDB' component ('Oracle XML Database') should be installed
Rem      proir to the Rules Manager implementation (use catqm.sql to install
Rem      XDB).
Rem      See Documentation for additional notes
