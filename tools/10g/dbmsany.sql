     DESCRIPTION
         Access functions for AnyData based on Built-ins are provided for
         SQL queriability.
         These functions do not throw exceptions on type-mismatch.
         Instead, they return NULL if the type of the AnyData does not
         correspond to the type of Access so that it is SQL friendly.
         If users want only those AnyData's of the appropriate Types returned
         in a Query, they should use a WHERE clause which uses
         GetTypeName() and choose the type they are interested in
         (say "SYS.NUMBER" etc.)

     DESCRIPTION
         Get's the next instance in an AnyDataSet. Only sequential access to
         the instances in an AnyDataSet is allowed. After this function has
         been called, the Get*() functions can be invoked on the

          this function before the AnyDataSet is fully created.
     PARAMETERS
         self (IN OUT )   - The AnyDataSet being accessed.
         return          - DBMS_TYPES.SUCCESS or DBMS_TYPES.NO_DATA. 
                           DBMS_TYPES.NO_DATA signifies the end of the

  /* NAME
         Get*.
     DESCRIPTION
         Gets the current data value (which should be of appropriate type)
         The type of the current data value depends on the MODE with which
         we are accessing (Depending on how we have invoked the
         PieceWise() call).
         If PieceWise() has NOT been called, we are accessing the
         instance in its entirety and the type of the data value should match
         the type of the AnyDataSet.
         If PieceWise() has been called, we are accessing the
         instance piece wise. The type of the data value should match the type
         of the attribute (or collection element) at the current position.
     PARAMETERS
         num - The Number that needs to be got. etc.
     RETURNS
         DBMS_TYPES.SUCCESS or DBMS_TYPES.NO_DATA
         The return value is relevant only if PieceWise
         has been already called (for a collection). In such a case,
         DBMS_TYPES.NO_DATA signifies the end of the collection when all
         elements have been accessed.
     EXCEPTIONS
         - DBMS_TYPES.invalid_parameters
           Invalid Parameters (if it is not appropriate to add a number
                               at this point in the creation process).
         - DBMS_TYPES.incorrect_usage
           Incorrect usage.
         - DBMS_TYPES.type_mismatch
           When the expected type is different from the passed in type.
