  * OVERVIEW
  *
  * This package allows a PL/SQL program to retrieve host name and
  * IP address information of local or remote host.  The functionality
  * provided by this package does not cover the full functionality of
  * Domain Name Resolution (also known as DNS).
  *
  * USES
  *
  * Call get_host_name() to retrieve the name of a local or remote host.
  * Call get_host_address() to retrieve the IP address of a local or remote
  * host.
  *
  * EXAMPLES
  *   Retrieve local host name and IP address.
  *
  * BEGIN
  *   dbms_output.put_line(utl_inaddr.get_host_name);  -- get local host name
  *   dbms_output.put_line(utl_inaddr.get_host_address);  -- get local IP addr
  * END;

   *         the local host will be returned and the name will not contain
   *         the domain to which the local host belongs.
   * RETURN
