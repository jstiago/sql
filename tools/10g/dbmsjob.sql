Rem    NAME
Rem      dbmsjob.sql - DBMS JOB queue interface
Rem    DESCRIPTION
Rem      Interface for the job queue
Rem    RETURNS
Rem 
Rem    NOTES
Rem      The job queue
Rem      (1) Runs user-defined routines from background processes
Rem          (or directly in the user's process)
Rem      (2) Runs the jobs at user defined times 
Rem          (or reasonably soon afterwards)
Rem      (3) Runs a given job repeatedly at user defined intervals
Rem          (or just once, then the job deletes itself)
Rem      (4) Runs the jobs in the same environment they were submitted in
Rem          (except with the user's default roles and privileges)
Rem      (5) Reports errors, and does exponential backoff.
Rem      (6) Allows the user to identify and administer these jobs. 
Rem
Rem      DBMS_JOB and DBMS_IJOB are the only interface for manipulating jobs.
Rem      Queries against the catalog should be used for examining jobs.
Rem      The catalog view dba_jobs and dba_jobs_running are in catjobq.sql.
Rem      Out of all these routines, only dbms_job.run and dbms_ijob.run have
Rem        implicit commits.
Rem
Rem      There are no kernel priveleges associated with jobs.  The right
Rem        to execute dbms_job or dbms_ijob takes their place.  dbms_job
Rem        does not allow a user to touch any jobs but their own.
Rem
Rem      (1) See the parameter WHAT in the specification for dbms_job for a
Rem          description of legal jobs.
Rem          The background processes are specified by init.ora parameters,
Rem          job_queue_processes=2   #two background processes
Rem          job_queue_interval=60   #the processes wake up every 60 seconds
Rem          job_queue_keep_connections=TRUE  #sleep, don't disconnect
Rem      (2) See NEXT_DATE in the specification for dbms_job
Rem      (3) See INTERVAL in the specification for dbms_job
Rem      (4) All the parameters that can be set with ALTER SESSION are stored
Rem          when a job is created (or when WHAT is changed), and they are
Rem          restored when the job is run.  See the view dba_jobs.
Rem      (5) When dbms_job.run() or dbms_ijob.run() encounters an error, the
Rem          complete errorstack is dumped to a trace file and an alert file.
Rem          If dbms_ijob.run() was used, the number of jobs that ran with
Rem          errors is reported to the user.
Rem      (6) Jobs are identified by job number.  Jobs can be exported and
Rem          imported again, and the job number will remain the same.

  any_instance CONSTANT BINARY_INTEGER := 0;

  -- Parameters are:
  --
  -- JOB is the number of the job being executed.
  -- WHAT is the PL/SQL procedure to execute.
  --   The job must always be a single call to a procedure.  The
  --     routine may take any number of hardcoded parameters.  
  --     Special parameter values recognized are:
  --       job:       an in parameter, the number of the current job
  --       next_date: in/out, the date of the next refresh
  --       broken:    in/out, is the job broken.  The IN values is FALSE.
  --   Always remember the trailing semicolon.
  --   Some legal values of WHAT (assuming the routines exist) are
  --     'myproc( ''10-JAN-82'', next_date, broken);'
  --     'scott.emppackage.give_raise( ''JENKINS'', 30000.00);'
  --     'dbms_job.remove( job);'
  -- NEXT_DATE is the date at which the job will next be automatically run,
  --   assuming there are background processes attempting to run it.
  -- INTERVAL is a date function, evaluated immediately before the job starts
  --   executing.  If the job completes successfully, this new date is placed
  --   in NEXT_DATE.  INTERVAL is evaluated by plugging it into the statement
  --     select INTERVAL into next_date from dual;
  --   INTERVAL must evaluate to a time in the future.  Legal intervals include
  --     'sysdate + 7'                    -- execute once a week
  --     'NEXT_DAY(sysdate,''TUESDAY'')'  -- execute once every tuesday
  --     'null'                           -- only execute once
  --   If INTERVAL evaluates to null and a job completes successfully, then
  --   the job is automatically deleted from the queue.
