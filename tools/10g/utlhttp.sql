  /******************************************************************
  
  The UTL_HTTP package makes Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) callouts
  from SQL and PL/SQL.  It can be used to access data on the Internet over
  the HTTP protocol.

  The package contains a set of API that enables users to write PL/SQL
  programs that communicate with Web (HTTP) servers.  It also contains a
  function that can be used in SQL queries.  Besides the HTTP protocol, it
  also supports the HTTP protocol over the Secured Socket Layer protocol (SSL),
  also known as HTTPS, directly or via a HTTP proxy.  Other Internet-related
  data-access protocols (such as the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or
  the Gopher protocol) are also supported via a HTTP proxy server that
  supports those protocols.

  When the package fetches data from a Web site using the HTTPS protocol,
  it requires an Oracle wallet to be set up properly by Oracle Wallet Manager.
  Non-HTTPS fetches do not require an Oracle wallet.

  The API is divided into a number of categories.  The session API manipulates
  configurations pertaining to the package within a database user session.
  The request API begins a new HTTP request, manipulates its attributes,
  and sends information to the Web server.  The response API returns the
  attributes of the response and receives information the response data
  from the Web server.  The cookies API manipulates the HTTP cookies maintained
  by the package within the database user session.  The persistent connection
  API manipulates the persistent connections maintained by the package.  There
  are also two simple functions that allow users to fetch a Web page by
  a single function call.

  The following is an example that illustrate the use of the session,
  request, and response API to pretend to be the Netscape brower to fetch
  a Web page.

  SET serveroutput ON SIZE 40000
  
  DECLARE
    req   utl_http.req;
    resp  utl_http.resp;
    value VARCHAR2(1024);
  BEGIN

    utl_http.set_proxy('proxy.it.my-company.com', 'my-company.com');

    req := utl_http.begin_request('http://www-hr.corp.my-company.com');
    utl_http.set_header(req, 'User-Agent', 'Mozilla/4.0');
    resp := utl_http.get_response(req);
    LOOP
      utl_http.read_line(resp, value, TRUE);
      dbms_output.put_line(value);
    END LOOP;
    utl_http.end_response(resp);
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN utl_http.end_of_body THEN
      utl_http.end_response(resp);
  END;

  The following is another example that illustrates how to use the simple
  API to fetch a Web page in SQL (only the first 2000 bytes will be returned).
  
  SVRMGR> select utl_http.request('http://www.oracle.com/')
       2  from dual;
  UTL_HTTP.REQUEST('HTTP://WWW.ORACLE.COM/')
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  <html>
  <head><title>Oracle Corporation Home Page</title>
  <!--changed Jan. 16, 19
  1 row selected.

  Here is another example that illustrates how to use the other simple API
  to fetch the complete Web page:

  set serveroutput on

  declare
    x   utl_http.html_pieces;
    len pls_integer;
  begin
    x := utl_http.request_pieces('http://www.oracle.com/', 100);
    dbms_output.put_line(x.count || ' pieces were retrieved.');
    dbms_output.put_line('with total length ');
    len := 0;
    for i in 1..x.count loop
      len := len + length(x(i));
    end loop;
    dbms_output.put_line(len);
  end;

  Here is the output:

  Statement processed.
  4 pieces were retrieved.
  with total length
  7687

  /**
   * Sets the proxy to be used for requests of the HTTP or other protocols,
   * excluding those for hosts which belong to the domain specified in
   * no_proxy_domains. proxy may include an optional TCP/IP port number
   * at which the proxy server listens at. If the port is not specified for the
   * proxy, port 80 is assumed.
   *
   * no_proxy_domains is a list of domains or hosts for which HTTP requests
   * should be sent directly to the destination HTTP server instead of going
   * through a proxy server. Optionally, a port number may be specified for
   * each domain or host. If the port number is specified, the no-proxy
   * restriction is only applied to the request at that port of the particular
   * domain or host. . When no_proxy_domains is
   * NULL and proxy is set, all requests go through the proxy. When proxy
   * is not set, UTL_HTTP sends the requests to the target Web servers
   * directly.
   *
   * PARAMETERS
   *   proxy             The proxy host and port number. The syntax is
   *                     "[http://]host[:port][/]".  For example,
   *                     "www-proxy.my-company.com:80".
   *   no_proxy_domains  The list of no-proxy domains or hosts.  The syntax is
   *                     a list of host or domains, with optional port numbers
   *                     separated by a comma, a semi-colon, or a space.

   *   miscellaneous runtime exceptions.
   * NOTES
   *   When a database session starts, it will assume the proxy settings
   *   in the environment variables "http_proxy" and "no_proxy" if they are
   *   set when the database server instance is started. Proxy settings set
   *   by this procedure overrides the initial settings.
   *
   *  The general format would be

   * If the cookie support is enabled for a HTTP request, all cookies that
   * are saved in the current session and are applicable to the request will
   * be returned to the Web server in the request in accordance to the HTTP
   * cookies specification RFC 2109 and to the draft proposal by Netscape
   * Communications Corporation. Cookies that are set in the response to

   * EXCEPTIONS
   *   miscellaneous runtime exceptions.
   * NOTES
   *   If the maximum total number of cookies and the maximum number of cookies
   *   per each Web site are lowered when this procedure is called, the
   *   oldest cookies will be purged first to reduce the number of cookies
   *   to satisfy those new maximum limits.
   *
   *   Note that the HTTP cookies saved in the current session will last for
   *   the duration of the database session only and there is no persistent
   *   storage for the cookies. An example is given in the package
   *   documentation to illustrate how to use get_cookies and add_cookies
   *   to retrieve, save, and restore the cookies.
   *
   *   Note that setting the default setting of the cookie support to disabled
   *   with this procedure does not cause the cookies saved in the current

   *
   * If the persistent-connection support is enabled for a HTTP request,
   * the package will keep the network connections to a Web server or the
   * proxy server open in the package after the request is completed properly
   * for a subsequent request to the same server to reuse per HTTP 1.1
   * protocol specification. With the persistent connection support,
   * subsequent HTTP requests may be completed faster because the network
   * connection latency is avoided. If the persistent-connection support
   * is disabled for a request, the package will always send the HTTP header
   * "Connection: close" automatically in the HTTP request and close the
   * network connection when the request is completed. This setting has no
   * effect on HTTP requests that follows HTTP 1.0 protocol, for which the
   * network connections will always be closed after the requests are
   * completed.
   *
   * When a request is being made, the package always attempts to reuse an
   * existing persistent connection to the target Web server (or proxy server)
   * if one is available. If none is available, a new network connection will
   * be initiated. The persistent-connection support setting for a request
   * affects only whether the network connection should be closed after a
   * request completes.
   *
   * The persistent-connection support is disabled for all HTTP requests by
   * default in a database user session. The default maximum numbers of
   * persistent connections saved in the current session is zero. Use this
   * procedure to change the default settings. The default setting
   * of the persistent-connection support (enabled vs. disabled) affects only
   * the future requests and has no effect on the existing ones.
   *
   * Once a request is created, the persistent-connection support setting
   * may be changed by using the other set_persistent_conn_support procedure
   * that operates on a request.
   *
   * Users should note that while the use of persistent connections in UTL_HTTP
   * may reduce the time it takes to fetch multiple Web pages from the same
   * server, it consumes precious system resources (network connections) in
   * the database server. Excessive use of persistent connections may
   * reduce the scalability of the database server when too many network
   * connections are kept open in the database server. Therefore, users should
   * exert discretion when using persistent connection. Network connections
   * should be kept open only if they will be used immediately by subsequent
   * requests and should be closed immediately when they are no longer needed.
   * Also, users are advised to set the default persistent connection support
   * support as disabled in the session, and to enable persistent connection in
   * individual HTTP requests as shown in the following code example:

  /**
   * Enables (or disables) the support for the HTTP 1.1 persistent-connection
   * in this request.
   *
   * If the persistent-connection support is enabled for a HTTP request,
   * the package will keep the network connections to a Web server or the
   * proxy server open in the package after the request is completed properly
   * for a subsequent request to the same server to reuse per HTTP 1.1
   * protocol specification. With the persistent connection support,
   * subsequent HTTP requests may be completed faster because the network
   * connection latency is avoided. If the persistent-connection support
   * is disabled for a request, the package will always send the HTTP header
   * "Connection: close" automatically in the HTTP request and close the
   * network connection when the request is completed. This setting has no
   * effect on HTTP requests that follows HTTP 1.0 protocol, for which the
   * network connections will always be closed after the requests are
   * completed.
   *
   * When a request is being made, the package always attempts to reuse an
   * existing persistent connection to the target Web server (or proxy server)
   * if one is available. If none is available, a new network connection will
   * be initiated. The persistent-connection support setting for a request
   * affects only whether the network connection should be closed after a
   * request completes.
   *
   * Use this procedure to change the persistent-connection support setting a
   * request inherits from the session's default setting.
   *
   * Users should note that while the use of persistent connections in UTL_HTTP
   * may reduce the time it takes to fetch multiple Web pages from the same
   * server, it consumes precious system resources (network connections) in
   * the database server. Also, excessive use of persistent connections may
   * reduce the scalability of the database server when too many network
   * connections are kept open in the database server. Therefore, users should
   * exert discretion when using persistent connection. Network connections
   * should be kept open only if they will be used immediately by subsequent
   * requests and should be closed immediately when they are no longer needed.
   * Also, users are advised to set the default persistent connection support
   * support as disabled in the session, and to enable persistent connection in
   * individual HTTP requests as shown in the following code example:
   *

   *     the request with end_request.

   * Notes on 100 Continue:
   * In certain situations (initiated by the HTTP client or not), the HTTP
   * server may return a 1xx informational response. The user who does not
   * expect such a response may indicate to get_response to ignore the response
   * and proceed to receive the regular response. In the case when the user
   * expects such a response, he can indicate to get_response to return the
   * response. For example, when a user is issuing a HTTP POST request with a
   * large request body, the user may want to check with the HTTP server to
   * ensure that the server will accept the request before sending the data.
   * To do so, the user will send the additional "Expect: 100-continue" request
   * header, check for "100 Continue" response from the server before
   * proceeding to send the request body. Then, the user will get the regular
   * HTTP response as he normally does. The following code example illustrates
   * this:
   * DECLARE
   *  data  VARCHAR2(1024) := '...';
   *  req   utl_http.req;
   *  resp  utl_http.resp;
   * BEGIN
   *
   *  req := utl_http.begin_request('http://www.acme.com/receiver', 'POST');
   * utl_http.set_header(req, 'Content-Length', length(data));
   *  -- Ask HTTP server to return "100 Continue" response
   *  utl_http.set_header(req, 'Expect', '100-continue');
   *  resp := utl_http.get_response(req, TRUE);
   *
   *  -- Check for and dispose "100 Continue" response
   *  IF (resp.status_code <> 100) THEN
   *    utl_http.end_response(resp);
   *    raise_application_error(20000, 'Request rejected');
   *  END IF;
   *  utl_http.end_response(resp);
   *
   *  -- Now, send the request body
   *  utl_http.write_text(req, data);

   *  -- Get the regular response
   *  resp := utl_http.get_response(req);
   *  utl_http.read_text(resp, data);
   *
   *  utl_http.end_response(resp);
   *
